### Patient Safety is Our Priority

In a healthcare setting, cleaning isn't just about appearance—it's about patient safety and infection control. Medical centres require a higher standard of hygiene than typical commercial spaces, and we are equipped to deliver exactly that.

Our team understands the critical importance of preventing cross-contamination and maintaining a sterile environment. We use color-coded cleaning materials and hospital-grade disinfectants to ensure every surface is safe for your patients and staff.

### Supporting Your Accreditation

We know that maintaining AGPAL or other healthcare accreditation is vital for your practice. Our cleaning protocols are designed to support your compliance requirements.
-   **Detailed Logging:** We keep records of cleaning schedules and tasks completed.
-   **Specialized Training:** Our cleaners understand the nuances of cleaning treatment rooms, waiting areas, and amenities.
-   **Responsive Service:** We are available for emergency cleans or rapid response if an incident occurs.

Partner with GCC Melbourne to ensure your medical centre reflects the high standard of care you provide to your patients.
